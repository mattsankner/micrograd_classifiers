# micrograd binary classifier notebooks and models

### In this repo, I use and make modifications to the @micrograd repository's multi-layer perceptron, ```mlp.py,``` and engine ```engine.py,``` to make better and more complex binary classifiers that force a better understanding of deep learning with neural networks and a better understanding of micrograd.
